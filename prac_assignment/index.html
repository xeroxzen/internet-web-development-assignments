    <h3>Hello there ðŸ‘‹ Andile Jaden here</h3>
    <h3>Who is Andile?</h3>

    <p>
      Andile is a phenomenon young man with lots of passion and ambition and an
      unparalled drive to be great in everything he does. Amongst his peers he's
      affectionately known as Google Jr because of his intellect, the way he
      sees things and how he knows so many things in many fields and at the same
      time is able to recall them without difficulty. He is a natural born
      problem solver and engineer at heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      What everyone didn't know was that in April of 2016, the last year of his
      High School he finally saw the light. Whilst attending a Scholastica
      Career Guidance workshop he finally discovered what he wanted to do and
      where he fit in. From that day onwards he only wanted to write code and be
      a damn good Software Engineer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nobody truly understood his change of course, they all thought it was cry
      for help, lack of proper guidance and many other demoralizing things. He
      never faltered, he finished High School and he began reading coding books
      encompassing Python (his favorite language), HTML, C#, C and Perl. He read
      coding books and did the tutorials with pen and paper. It wasn't until
      August 2017 he finally got a laptop for one purpose alone, to write code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today he is a software engineer for a tech start-up where he is the Lead
      Developer. He got to where he is through hardwork, sleepless nights and
      unparalled passion. He started at the company as an intern and because of
      his hunger and drive to grow he was asked to join the company's
      developer's team on a permanent contract. He is also at school where he is
      studying Computer Science, he is doing his 4th and last year.
    </p>

    <h3>How he got here?</h3>
    <p>
      After completing High School most assumed he would be heading to
      University to study Law or Political Science because those around him saw
      a debater, someone full of ideas that would be better used towards
      community and public policy development.

    <h3 id="title1"></h3>
    <p>
      There are quite a lot of things he is grateful for but what ranks highly
      to him are the networks he has navigated for himself. He is grateful to
      people like Vuyisile Ndlovu who served as the go to person when he got on
      this path and the one person who got him to love Python. He is most
      grateful to Eric Khumalo and EmziniWeCode who have pushed him thus far and
      always believed in him.
